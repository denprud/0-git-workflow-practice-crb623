[Federal Trade Commission Launches Inquiry Into A.I. Deals by Tech Giants](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/technology/ftc-ai-microsoft-amazon-google.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Rk0.1GCt.HD2i9_ORSpCT&bgrp=a&smid=url-share)

This article is interesting because it discusses The F.T.C. and the Justice Department's attempt to regulate tech giants with antitrust laws. Regulatory bodies are specifically scrutinizing Microsoft, Amazon, and Google for their investments in the A.I. start-ups OpenAI and Anthropic. I find it weird that regulatory bodies have chosen this route instead of directly regulating A.I. start-ups. From my understanding, law and policy is an incredibly traditional field. However, as the capabilities of artificial intelligence grow, issues such as data management must be regulated at the source, as opposed to regulating second-level interactions.

No article has been posted yet but im sure it is interesting!

Comment from Zhongqian Chen:

A.I. is a powerful technology that has risen in both capability and popularity during these past few years, and in my opinion it is definitely necessary to make up laws and regulations for it and any fields of technology that has relation to it, in order to prevent unexpected outcomes from the loopholes of the rules.

Comment from Isaac Kwon:

A.I. has certainly been at the forefront of many discussions. The amount of money that has entered the space as pointed out by the article is simply mind boggling. With even people who have grown up with technology, the capabilities of A.I can seem like something we would see in 2100. I am hopeful that rules and regulations are put in place to tamper the more harmful aspects of A.I., but I am not entirely confident that negative externalities will be adequately addressed.


Comment from Denzel Prudent:

The drama and discussions about the current events in AI technology leaves a lot to wonder what will happen next. I am ultimately hopeful that whatever follows will ultimately lead to the betterment of A.I. tech.


Comment from Wei Luo:
Software engineering, as an industry, is not just limited to coding and computer science creativity. Legal issues and documentations are also required to be considered for a technology business to succeed.As a society's techbology, like AI, advances, the legal system will have to evolves to regulate it from losing control and becoming tool of injustice and immortality.
